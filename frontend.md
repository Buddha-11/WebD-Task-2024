# Academic Archive Portal - Frontend

## Let the Games Begin:

### Set Up Your Battle Station (5 points)

- Start by forging a new private repository named **"Webd-AcademicArchive-FrontEnd"**—because we all know that naming things is half the battle.
- Roll out the red carpet by inviting the WebD Coordinators as collaborators. Their Github IDs are **lavishmeena2764**, **Harshal5167**, **Jarviss77,** and **automatefreely**. If you can't spell those right, maybe you should reconsider your career choices.

## The Main Event:
### Conjuring the Frontend

- Strap in! Your mission, should you choose to accept it (which you have to), is to build a stunning, responsive frontend for a "Previous Year Notes and Question Paper Collection Website". You’re free to choose any tech stack—**ReactJs, NextJs**, or whatever framework you think will make you look like a wizard.
- **Admin Kingdom:** Craft a majestic admin portal where admins reign supreme, reviewing the peasants’ (students’) submissions. Their approval is the final word!
- **Student Dashboard of Dreams:** Create a sleek student dashboard where they can browse through their organization's treasures—past notes and question papers—or offer their own contributions to the academic gods.
- **Approval Limbo:** Implement a purgatory-like queue where students' hopeful uploads await the admin's divine judgment.
- **Treasure Hunt:** Add a search feature so students can sift through the academic archives and find that one paper that might actually save their grade.

### Bonus Round (Optional Features):

- **Category Magic:** Let students filter content by category—because sometimes, they might actually know what they're looking for.
- **Peasant Commentary:** Give users the ability to comment on the content—because everyone needs a place to vent about how impossible that one question was.
- **Dark Mode Sorcery:** Cast a dark mode spell to save those late-night crammers from burning their retinas.

## The Student Experience:

- **Profile Prowess:** Add a student profile section where they can gaze upon their own details. Maybe even throw in a mirror so they can admire their coding-induced dark circles.
- **Login Ritual:** Implement a login page where students can enter using their sacred LDAP credentials. No password? No entry!

## The Judge’s Scorecard:

- **Originality and Flair:** We’re looking for that extra sparkle. Don't just color within the lines—redraw the whole picture.
- **Code Feng Shui:** Your code should be as clean and organized as your room probably isn’t. We’re talking modular, maintainable, and free of whatever that mystery bug is.
- **Feature Excellence:** Ensure your features not only exist but actually work. We’d like to be impressed, not just politely interested.
- **User Journey:** Design with the user in mind—make their journey through your site as smooth as a fresh jar of Skippy.
- **Documentation Diaries:** Leave a breadcrumb trail of comments and documentation, so others can follow your genius (or madness).

## Submitting Your Magnum Opus:

- **Deadline:** Complete your masterpiece by **11/09/24, 11:59 pm**. Remember, sleep is for the weak.
- **Submission:** Make sure your repository is locked and loaded, with clear instructions on how to make your creation come to life.
