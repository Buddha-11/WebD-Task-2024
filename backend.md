# Academic Archive Portal - Backend

## Let the Games Begin:

### Set Up Your Battle Station (5 points)

- Start by forging a new private repository named **"Webd-AcademicArchive-BackEnd"**—because we all know that naming things is half the battle.
- Roll out the red carpet by inviting the WebD Coordinators as collaborators. Their Github IDs are **lavishmeena2764**, **Harshal5167**, **Jarviss77**, and **automatefreely**. If you can't spell those right, maybe you should reconsider your career choices.

## The Main Event:
### Mission Backend:

- **Tech Stack Wizardry:** Your backend arsenal consists of **Express.js, Flask, Django** or any other you want to work on. Pick your weapon of choice to create a **REST API** that will serve as the backbone of the entire operation.
- **Guardians of Access:** Establish secure login and registration endpoints, fortified with **JWT-based authentication**. Ensure separate login flows for admins and students, granting them appropriate access to their respective realms.
- **Admin Kingdom:** Build an authoritative API where admins can ascend to power, reviewing student offerings, and passing their final, binding judgment. Admins will have the keys to the kingdom—approving submissions, and maintaining the sanctity of the academic archives.
- **Student Dashboard of Dreams API:** Forge endpoints that allow students to enter their personalized dashboard, where they can browse their organization’s vaults of wisdom—previous notes and question papers. Craft endpoints for uploading their own contributions, hoping to appease the academic gods.
- **Approval Limbo:** Construct a purgatorial queue where student submissions await their fate. Admins will use this space to determine which offerings are worthy of joining the hallowed archives.
- **Treasure Hunt API:** Develop a search mechanism that lets students sift through the database, unearthing the exact notes or question papers they need to triumph in their academic battles.

### Bonus Round (Optional Features):

- **Category Magic API:** Enchant your backend with endpoints that allow students to filter content by category. This will give them the illusion of control as they navigate through the academic archives, seeking exactly what they need.
- **Peasant Commentary API:** Cast a spell to enable user comments on content. This feature will provide a platform for students to share their thoughts, frustrations, and insights about specific notes or questions, fostering a sense of community (or commiseration).
- **S3 Storage Magic:** Integrate **AWS S3** instead of Cloudinary for storing all uploaded notes and question papers. Your backend should wield the power to securely upload, retrieve, and manage these files in the cloud, ensuring they’re safe from the ravages of time (or server crashes).
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL with Prisma:** Channel the power of relational databases with **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**, using **Prisma** as your ORM tool. Set up your schema to handle users, organizations, submissions, categories, and comments with the elegance and efficiency of a seasoned sorcerer.

## The Judge’s Scorecard:

- **Originality and Flair:** We’re looking for that extra sparkle. Don't just color within the lines—redraw the whole picture.
- **Code Feng Shui:** Your code should be as clean and organized as your room probably isn’t. We’re talking modular, maintainable, and free of whatever that mystery bug is.
- **Feature Excellence:** Ensure your features not only exist but actually work. We’d like to be impressed, not just politely interested.
- **User Journey:** Design with the user in mind—make their journey through your site as smooth as a fresh jar of Skippy.
- **Documentation Diaries:** Leave a breadcrumb trail of comments and documentation, so others can follow your genius (or madness).

## Submitting Your Magnum Opus:

- **Deadline:** Complete your masterpiece by **11/09/24, 11:59 pm**. Remember, sleep is for the weak.
- **Submission:** Make sure your repository is locked and loaded, with clear instructions on how to make your creation come to life.

This challenge isn’t just about crossing items off a list. It’s about showing off your style, your creativity, and your ability to make a backend that brings users to tears (of joy). Go forth, code warrior, and may your API calls be swift and flawless!

**Remember:** The road to a great backend is paved with well-placed endpoints and a lot of caffeine. The Web Development Wing eagerly awaits your legendary backend creation!
